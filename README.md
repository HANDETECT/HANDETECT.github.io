Welcome to the **HANDETECT** Project! Our goal is to develop an innovative AI-powered system that facilitates early detection and monitoring of movement disorders through handwriting assessment. We are excited to embark on this journey and contribute to the advancement of medical research in this field.

## About Movement Disorders
Movement disorders encompass a wide range of neurological conditions that affect the ability to control voluntary and involuntary movements. These conditions can lead to difficulties in handwriting and other motor-related tasks. Through our research, we aim to improve the understanding of movement disorders and enable early intervention for better patient outcomes.

### Target Movement Disorders of Our Research
- Parkinson's Disease (PD)
- Essential Tremor (ET)
- Huntington's Disease (HD)
- Dystonia
- Tourette Syndrome (TS)
- Cerebral Palsy (CP)
- Ataxia
- Wilson's Disease
- Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)
- Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)
- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)


## Our Approach
Our unique approach involves analyzing handwriting patterns to detect subtle motor abnormalities associated with movement disorders. By administering a series of simple drawing tasks, we can gather valuable data that may aid in the identification and tracking of various movement disorders.

## Participate in our Project
We are currently recruiting patients of [our target disorders](https://handetect.github.io/#target-movement-disorders-of-our-research).

We welcome participants who have been diagnosed with movement disorders to take part in our handwriting assessment. 

It takes less than 10 minutes to complete.

Download it [here](https://handetect.github.io/Handwriting-Assessment-Form.pdf).

### Submit Methods
- **Google Drive** - We have created a Google Drive folder, which participants may conveniently take photos or scan their assessment results sheet and upload there.
- **Email** - Participants may send their assessment results through our [email](m-938903@moe-dl.edu.my)
- **WhatsApp** - Participants may also conveniently take photos of their assessment results sheet and send us through [WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601110805339)
- **Physical Mail** - Participants can send the assessment results sheet to the following address:

  Chung Ling High School
  23, Kampung Baharu,
  11400 Ayer Itam,
  Penang, Malaysia.

## Data Privacy and Confidentiality
We understand the importance of data privacy and confidentiality. Rest assured, all participant data will be treated with the utmost care and stored securely. Personal information will be anonymized to protect participants' identities.

## Collaboration Opportunities
We are open to collaborating with medical professionals, research institutions, and patient organizations dedicated to movement disorders. If you are interested in partnering with us or have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
