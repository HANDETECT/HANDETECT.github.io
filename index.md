Welcome to the **HANDETECT** Project! Our goal is to develop an innovative AI-powered system that facilitates early detection and monitoring of movement disorders through handwriting assessment. We are excited to embark on this journey and contribute to the advancement of medical research in this field.

## About Movement Disorders
Movement disorders encompass a wide range of neurological conditions that affect the ability to control voluntary and involuntary movements. These conditions can lead to difficulties in handwriting and other motor-related tasks. Through our research, we aim to improve the understanding of movement disorders and enable early intervention for better patient outcomes.

### Target Movement Disorders of Our Research
- Parkinson's Disease (PD)
- Essential Tremor (ET)
- Huntington's Disease (HD)
- Dystonia
- Tourette Syndrome (TS)
- Cerebral Palsy (CP)
- Ataxia
- Wilson's Disease
- Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)
- Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)
- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)


## Participate in our Project
We are currently recruiting patients of [our target disorders](https://handetect.github.io/#target-movement-disorders-of-our-research) for our research.

We welcome participants who have been diagnosed with movement disorders to take part in our **handwriting assessment**. It takes **less than 10 minutes** to complete.

Download the handwriting assessment form [here](https://handetect.github.io/Handwriting-Assessment-Form.pdf).

You may print it out and complete the assessment and submit it to us via the methods below.

### Submission Methods
- **Google Drive** - We have created a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cp5E0S7IIdw1-g_QHG-_dboe4Bo9RvrM?usp=sharing), which participants may conveniently take photos or scan their assessment results sheet and upload there.
- **Email** - Participants may send their assessment results through our email: <m-9389033@moe-dl.edu.my>.
- **WhatsApp** - Participants may also conveniently take photos of their assessment results sheet and send us through [WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601110805339).
- **Physical Mail** - Participants can send the assessment results sheet to the following address:
```
  Chung Ling High School
  23, Kampung Baharu,
  11400 Ayer Itam,
  Penang, Malaysia.
```

Thanks for your participation, your dedication and willingness to be part of this project have been truly appreciated.

## Data Privacy and Confidentiality
We understand the importance of data privacy and confidentiality. Rest assured, all participant data will be treated with the utmost care and stored securely. Personal information will be anonymized to protect participants' identities. All data will be stored locally in a computer which is only assessible by the research team. The data will be deleted after the research has done.

## Collaboration Opportunities
We are open to collaborating with medical professionals, research institutions, and patient organizations dedicated to [movement disorders](https://handetect.github.io/#target-movement-disorders-of-our-research). If you are interested in partnering with us, please feel free to reach out to us at <m-9389033@moe-dl.edu.my>.
